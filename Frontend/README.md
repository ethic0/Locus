# How it works

### Making requests to the backend API


If you want to change the API URL to a local server, simply edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and change `api_url` to the local server's URL (i.e. `localhost:8080/api`)


# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://docs.npmjs.com/), then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
